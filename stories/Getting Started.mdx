# @reactleaf/input

`@reactleaf/input` is a set of input components.

## Motivation

I used to handle forms with `react-hook-form`. But some UI libraries needs to be wrapped by `<Controller />` of `react-hook-form`.
So I made my own components that are perfectly compatible with `react-hook-form`, but I encounted some cases, that `hook-form` is over-engineered.

`@reactleaf/input` is designed for usecases that are compatible with `react-hook-form`, but can be used without `react-hook-form`.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @reactleaf/input
```

## Examples

### With `react-hook-form`

```tsx
import { TextInput } from "@reactleaf/input/with-hook-form"

function FormComponent() {
  const form = useForm({ defaultValues: { street1: "" } })
  return (
    <FormContextProvider {...form}>
      <TextInput name="street1" label="Street 1" />
    </FormContextProvider>
  )
}
```

### Just as uncontrolled input

```tsx
import { TextInput } from "@reactleaf/input"

function FormComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("")
  return <TextInput label="Street 1" value={value} onValueChange={(v) => setValue(v)} />
}
```
