# @reactleaf/input

`@reactleaf/input` is a set of input components.

## Motivation

I used to handle forms with `react-hook-form`. But some UI libraries needs to be wrapped by `<Controller />` of `react-hook-form`.
So I made my own components that are perfectly compatible with `react-hook-form`.
But also in some cases, I need pure inputs, that `hook-form` is over-engineered.

`@reactleaf/input` is designed for usecases that are pure inputs.

Every `@reactleaf/input` components have their twin components that designed for usecases with `react-hook-form` compatible. \
It exports same components, but needs some hook-form props: `name`.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @reactleaf/input

```

or to use with react-hook-form

```sh
pnpm add @reactleaf/input react-hook-form
```

## Examples

### Just as Pure uncontrolled input

```tsx
import { TextInput } from "@reactleaf/input"

function FormComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("")
  return <TextInput label="Street 1" value={value} onValueChange={(v) => setValue(v)} />
}
```

### Easily combined with `react-hook-form`

```tsx
import { TextInput } from "@reactleaf/input/hookform"

function FormComponent() {
  const form = useForm({ defaultValues: { street1: "" } })
  return (
    <>
      {/* WithFormProvider */}
      <FormProvider {...form}>
        <TextInput name="street1" label="Street 1" rules={{ required: "Street is Required!" }} />
      </FormProvider>

      {/* WithoutFormProvider */}
      <TextInput name="street2" label="Street 2" control={form.control} />
    </>
  )
}
```
