# \<FileInput />

FileInput is a special input to handle single file.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />
<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Value Type of \<FileInput />

While we are using forms, create and update forms are quite similar. They are almost same.
But handling files, there are some differences rather than handling text or number.
When we use file in input, the file will be uploaded.
And If we want to check the details, the field will be filled with the url of the file.

So to handle those forms, we need to handle two different forms or inputs : file and url.
`<FileInput />` solves the problem by using `FileSource` type.

```ts
type FileSource = UploadedFile | SelectedFile
interface UploadedFile {
  type: "url"
  url: string
}

interface SelectedFile {
  type: "file"
  file: File | null
}
```

### Use in `react-hook-form`

`onChange` in `<FileInput />` will return formatted `string` value, \
so using `register()` is not recommended in this component.

```tsx
import { FileInput, FileSource } from "@reactleaf/input"

function FormComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<FileSource>({ type: "file", file: null })

  return <FileInput label="image" value={value} onValueChange={(v) => setValue(v)} />
}
```

## Props

<Controls
  of={Stories.Playground}
  include={["label", "errorMessage", "maxFileSize", "onValueChange", "renderPreview"]}
/>
